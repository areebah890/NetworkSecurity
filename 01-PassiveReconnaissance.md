<summary>Passive Vs Active Recon</summary>

## Passive Recon
- we rely on publicly available knowledge
- knowledge we can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target
- passive recon activities include:
looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server
checking job ads related to the target website
reading a news article about the target company

## Active Recon
- not achieved discreetly, requires engagement with target
- active recon activities include:
connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering)
entering company premises pretending to be a repairman

<summary>WhoIs</summary>

## What is WHOIS?

- WHOIS is a public query system that lets you look up information about who owns a domain name (like tryhackme.com) or an IP address
- managed by ICANN and domain registrars
- it usually gives you info such as:
Who registered the domain (sometimes hidden by privacy services),
When it was created,
When it expires,
Which registrar itâ€™s with,
Which DNS servers it uses.

1. Domain Info
- Domain Name: tryhackme.com
- Registry Domain ID: Unique identifier in the .COM registry (2282723194_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN).

2. Registrar (the company managing the domain)
- Registrar: NameCheap, Inc. (IANA ID: 1068)
- Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com
- Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com

3. Important Dates
- Created: 2018-07-05
- Updated: 2025-05-11
- Expires: 2034-07-05

This tells you the domain has been around for a while and is registered far into the future (indicates a serious, established service).

4. Domain Status
- clientTransferProhibited â†’ means the domain cannot easily be transferred between registrars without explicit approval. This is a security measure against hijacking.

5. Registrant (Owner) Info
- Name/Organization: Redacted (using a privacy protection service: Withheld for Privacy ehf in Iceland).
- Contact Email: Hidden behind a privacy-protected proxy.

Most legitimate sites use privacy protection

6. Name Servers (DNS)
- kip.ns.cloudflare.com
- uma.ns.cloudflare.com

shows the site uses Cloudflare, which provides DNS hosting, DDoS protection, and CDN services.

7. DNSSEC
- Status: unsigned â†’ DNSSEC isnâ€™t enabled (it adds cryptographic protection for DNS lookups)

**Impact:**

Info collected can be inspected to find new attack surfaces (like social engineering or technical attacks). Depending on the scope of the penetration test, we may consider an attack against the email server pf the admin user or the DNS servers (assuming they are owned by our client)

Due to automated tools abusing WHOIS queries to harvest email addresses, many WHOIS services take measures (like redacting email addresses).

Many registrants subscribe to privacy services to avoid email addresses being harvested by spammers and keep their info private.

<summary>nslookup and dig</summary>

## nslookup (Name Server Look up) Basics 

- Command: nslookup [OPTIONS] DOMAIN_NAME [SERVER]

- Parameters:

OPTIONS â†’ query type (A = IPv4, AAAA = IPv6, etc.)

DOMAIN_NAME â†’ the domain to look up

SERVER â†’ DNS server to query (e.g., Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8, Quad9 9.9.9.9).

ðŸ‘‰ Example: nslookup tryhackme.com

### ðŸ“– Common `nslookup` Query Types

| Query type | Result             |
|------------|--------------------|
| A          | IPv4 Addresses     |
| AAAA       | IPv6 Addresses     |
| CNAME      | Canonical Name     |
| MX         | Mail Servers       |
| SOA        | Start of Authority |
| TXT        | TXT Records        |

---
Examples
---

return all the IPv4 addresses used by tryhackme.com:

<img width="349" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dca2ae3-9c76-477e-a6b6-2f75ad04d11e" />

A and AAAA records return IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. From a pentesting perspective, these lookups expand a single domain into multiple IPs, each of which can then be tested for potential vulnerabilities (if in scope).

---

want to learn about the email servers and configurations for a particular domain. can issue nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com. 

<img width="326" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cda4151-51ef-450a-bea6-31c1998cfbb5" />

MX lookups show a domainâ€™s mail servers. For tryhackme.com, Googleâ€™s mail servers (aspmx.l.google.com, etc.) handle email delivery, with priority determining failover order. Since Google manages them, they are unlikely to be vulnerable, but other domains might expose insecure or outdated mail servers. Such findings are useful in passive reconnaissance, and similar queries (e.g., -type=txt) can reveal additional information.

---

## dig

- dig (Domain Information Groper): more advanced than nslookup for DNS queries.
- Basic usage: dig DOMAIN_NAME
- Specify record type: dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE (e.g., MX, A, TXT).
- Specify DNS server: dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE
- Parameters:

SERVER â†’ DNS server to query

DOMAIN_NAME â†’ target domain

TYPE â†’ record type (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.)

<summary>DNSDumpster</summary>

- DNS lookup tools (nslookup, dig) cannot find subdomains automatically.
- Subdomains (e.g., wiki.tryhackme.com, webmail.tryhackme.com) may reveal valuable info or contain vulnerable services if not regularly updated.
- Discovery methods:

Use multiple search engines to find publicly known subdomains.

Brute-force DNS queries to find existing subdomains.

Use online tools like DNSDumpster for faster discovery.

- DNSDumpster features:

Finds subdomains not easily discoverable by standard DNS queries (e.g., blog.tryhackme.com).

Provides DNS info in tables and graphs.

Resolves domain names to IP addresses and attempts geolocation.

Shows MX records with corresponding IPs and owner/location info.

Displays TXT records.

- A single query on DNSDumpster can provide a comprehensive view of a domainâ€™s DNS setup.

## Passive Reconnaissance Overview

- Focus: Gathering information without directly connecting to the target.
- Tools covered: Command-line utilities (whois, nslookup, dig) and online services (DNSDumpster, Shodan.io).
- Benefit: Collect a large amount of information about targets, including domain ownership, DNS records, mail servers, and connected devices.

### Passive Reconnaissance Command Examples

| Purpose                             | Command Example                           |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lookup WHOIS record                 | `whois tryhackme.com`                    |
| Lookup DNS A records                | `nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com`        |
| Lookup DNS MX records at DNS server | `nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1` |
| Lookup DNS TXT records              | `nslookup -type=TXT tryhackme.com`      |
| Lookup DNS A records (dig)          | `dig tryhackme.com A`                    |
| Lookup DNS MX records at DNS server (dig) | `dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX`       |
| Lookup DNS TXT records (dig)        | `dig tryhackme.com TXT`                  |

## Recommended Passive Recon Workflow
WHOIS â†’ nslookup/dig â†’ DNSDumpster â†’ Shodan.io
